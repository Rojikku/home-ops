# How I re-build once my cluster is up
<details>
    <summary>Cluster Details/Original Text</summary>

Highly opinionated template for deploying a single [k3s](https://k3s.io) cluster with [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com) and [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io) backed by [Flux](https://toolkit.fluxcd.io/) and [SOPS](https://toolkit.fluxcd.io/guides/mozilla-sops/).

The purpose here is to showcase how you can deploy an entire Kubernetes cluster and show it off to the world using the [GitOps](https://www.weave.works/blog/what-is-gitops-really) tool [Flux](https://toolkit.fluxcd.io/). When completed, your Git repository will be driving the state of your Kubernetes cluster. In addition with the help of the [Ansible](https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.sops), [Terraform](https://github.com/carlpett/terraform-provider-sops) and [Flux](https://toolkit.fluxcd.io/guides/mozilla-sops/) SOPS integrations you'll be able to commit Age encrypted secrets to your public repo.

## :wave:&nbsp; Introduction

The following components will be installed in your [k3s](https://k3s.io/) cluster by default. They are only included to get a minimum viable cluster up and running. You are free to add / remove components to your liking but anything outside the scope of the below components are not supported by this template.

Feel free to read up on any of these technologies before you get started to be more familiar with them.

- [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/) - SSL certificates - with Cloudflare DNS challenge
- [calico](https://www.tigera.io/project-calico/) - CNI (container network interface)
- [flux](https://toolkit.fluxcd.io/) - GitOps tool for deploying manifests from the `cluster` directory
- [hajimari](https://github.com/toboshii/hajimari) - start page with ingress discovery
- [kube-vip](https://kube-vip.io/) - layer 2 load balancer for the Kubernetes control plane
- [local-path-provisioner](https://github.com/rancher/local-path-provisioner) - default storage class provided by k3s
- [metallb](https://metallb.universe.tf/) - bare metal load balancer
- [reloader](https://github.com/stakater/Reloader) - restart pods when Kubernetes `configmap` or `secret` changes
- [system-upgrade-controller](https://github.com/rancher/system-upgrade-controller) - upgrade k3s
- [traefik](https://traefik.io) - ingress controller

For provisioning the following tools will be used:

- [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/download/server) - this is a pretty universal operating system that supports running all kinds of home related workloads in Kubernetes
- [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com) - this will be used to provision the Ubuntu operating system to be ready for Kubernetes and also to install k3s
- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io) - in order to help with the DNS settings this will be used to provision an already existing Cloudflare domain and DNS settings

## :memo:&nbsp; Prerequisites

### :computer:&nbsp; Systems

- One or more nodes with a fresh install of [Ubuntu Server 20.04](https://ubuntu.com/download/server). These nodes can be bare metal or VMs.
- A [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) account with a domain, this will be managed by Terraform.
- Some experience in debugging problems and a positive attitude ;)

### :warning:&nbsp; pre-commit

It is advisable to install [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) and the pre-commit hooks that come with this repository.
[sops-pre-commit](https://github.com/k8s-at-home/sops-pre-commit) and [gitleaks](https://github.com/zricethezav/gitleaks) will check to make sure you are not by accident committing your secrets un-encrypted.

After pre-commit is installed on your machine run:

```sh
pre-commit install-hooks
```

## :open_file_folder:&nbsp; Repository structure

The Git repository contains the following directories under `cluster` and are ordered below by how Flux will apply them.

- **base** directory is the entrypoint to Flux
- **crds** directory contains custom resource definitions (CRDs) that need to exist globally in your cluster before anything else exists
- **core** directory (depends on **crds**) are important infrastructure applications (grouped by namespace) that should never be pruned by Flux
- **apps** directory (depends on **core**) is where your common applications (grouped by namespace) could be placed, Flux will prune resources here if they are not tracked by Git anymore

```
cluster
├── apps
│   ├── default
│   ├── networking
│   └── system-upgrade
├── base
│   └── flux-system
├── core
│   ├── cert-manager
│   ├── metallb-system
│   ├── namespaces
│   └── system-upgrade
└── crds
    └── cert-manager
```

## :rocket:&nbsp; Lets go!

Very first step will be to create a new repository by clicking the **Use this template** button on this page.

Clone the repo to you local workstation and `cd` into it.

:round_pushpin: **All of the below commands** are run on your **local** workstation, **not** on any of your cluster nodes.

### :closed_lock_with_key:&nbsp; Setting up Age

:round_pushpin: Here we will create a Age Private and Public key. Using SOPS with Age allows us to encrypt and decrypt secrets.

1. Create a Age Private / Public Key

```sh
age-keygen -o age.agekey
```

2. Set up the directory for the Age key and move the Age file to it

```sh
mkdir -p ~/.config/sops/age
mv age.agekey ~/.config/sops/age/keys.txt
```

3. Export the `SOPS_AGE_KEY_FILE` variable in your `bashrc`, `zshrc` or `config.fish` and source it, e.g.

```sh
export SOPS_AGE_KEY_FILE=~/.config/sops/age/keys.txt
source ~/.bashrc
```

4. Fill out the Age public key in the `.config.env` under `BOOTSTRAP_AGE_PUBLIC_KEY`, **note** the public key should start with `age`...

## Verify cluster

1. Verify the nodes are online, after deploying the cluster with Sidero.

```sh
kubectl get nodes
# NAME           STATUS   ROLES                       AGE     VERSION
# k8s-0          Ready    control-plane,master      4d20h   v1.21.5+k3s1
# k8s-1          Ready    worker                    4d20h   v1.21.5+k3s1
```

### :small_blue_diamond:&nbsp; GitOps with Flux

1. [Bootstrap flux](/cluster/bootstrap/readme.md) but don't deploy the full flux yet

2. Disable the apps as needed for your cluster

3. Install full flux and wait for everything to deploy

4. Watch rook-ceph and hope it's a good child `watch kubectl get pods -n rook-ceph`

9. Prevent Apps from being deployed, because the cluster isn't ready for that yet.
```
flux suspend kustomization apps
```
10. Wait for rook to figure its life out for a bit. Usually within about 10 minutes it'll get everything needed setup, and the WebUI will come up.
```
watch kubectl -n rook-ceph get pods
```
If desired, login to the web UI with the password from:
```
kubectl -n rook-ceph get secret rook-ceph-dashboard-password -o jsonpath="{['data']['password']}" | base64 --decode && echo
```
11. Taint the master so it's dedicated. We didn't do this earlier because the OSD job is stupid.
```
kubectl taint node k8s-0 node-role.kubernetes.io/master=true:NoSchedule
```
12. Remove pods that shouldn't be on master based on output from the following. (Device-manager!)
```
kubectl get pods -A --field-selector spec.nodeName=k8s-0
```
13. Setup labels for my pods so that things will deploy correctly later.
```
kubectl label node k8s-4 feature.node.kubernetes.io/custom-zwave=true
kubectl label node k8s-3 rclone=enabled
```
14. Restore from backup with method of choice [Stash](./stash-restore)
